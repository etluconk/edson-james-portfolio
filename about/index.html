                    About Me
                </h1>
                <p>
                    I've been growing up in Seattle, Washington for most of my
                    life. I'm passionate about the things I make and I love
                    sharing those creative outlets with the people I love. I
                    care deeply about music, visual art and interactive media.
                    Currently, I'm primarily pursuing piano, cartooning, and
                    video game development.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    More recently, I've also taken up a huge interest in fashion
                    and other means of personal expression. I'm fascinated by
                    the ways people can be advocative and aware of their own
                    wellbeing throughout their lives, especially during
                    childhood.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm also interested in religion and politics. This is
                    because of my experiences and relationships with people of
                    varying beliefs, but also because of the ways I've noticed
                    social media and news outlets shaping (and polarizing) so
                    many peoples' opinions. While I might talk about these
                    topics on this website, I won't ever be talking about
                    <i>my personal</i> beliefs here. In my opinion, my political
                    and religious views aren't really relevant to the kinds of
                    creative projects I'm showing here :)
